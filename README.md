# Burstly ANE

## Compiling

Use the 'ant' command within the BurstlyANE/build folder. This will generate BurstlyANE/bin/BurstlyANE.ane. Not
e that we have included the compiled ANE in this repository for convenience.

## Adding to your Project (Flash Builder)

- Add the ANE to your project build path (Properties > Flex Build Path > Native Extensions)
- Add the ANE to your builds (Properties > Flex Build Packaging > Apple iOS / Google Android > Native Extensions) by checking the Package checkbox for BurstlyANE.ane
- Add the contents of bin-files/ into your project's bin directory (bin or bin-debug) and ensure that the contents are packaged into the APK as well (Properties > Flex Build Packaging > Google Android > Package Contents)

## Setting up the Manifest (Android only)

- Add the following node to the <android> tag of your application if you require Android support:

        <manifestAdditions><![CDATA[

# Technical Documentation

## TestFlight

### Introduction

com.burstly.plugins.TestFlight provides a bridge to all native TestFlight functionality. To use TestFlight for Android, the following tags *MUST* be defined in your AndroidManifest.xml:

			    <application
        			android:name="com.burstly.plugins.TestFlightApplication"
        			android:debuggable="true">
			    
			    	<meta-data android:name="testflight-app-token" android:value="2cb80607-50c0-4f00-819a-e8f1851909b4" />   
			    
			    	â€¦

			    </application>

If both the com.burstly.plugins.TestFlightApplication and the testflight-app-token meta-data tags are not defined in your AndroidManifest.xml, absolutely *NO* TestFlight functionality will be present in your app.
